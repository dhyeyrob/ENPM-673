# ENPM673 - Project3
## Introduction
* In this project the task is to apply the stereo vision techniques. For this three separate dataset of images has been provided.
* Firstly, it is required to compute the Fundamental and Essential matrix from the matching features obtained by SIFT detector. The next step is to rectify the images and get the disparity map. And finally from the disparity map it is required to calculte the depth map.
## Files
* There are three files in the folder. There is one python file, one pdf report file and one readme file. The name of python file is as follows:
* problem_1.py
## Libraries Required
* OpenCv
* Numpy
* random
* Matplotlib
* tqdm
## Instructions To Run The Code
* Please copy all the 3 datasets in this directory.
* Open the python file.
* Check whether all the libraries are installed or not.
* Run the code.
* The user will be required to enter any one of the 1, 2 or 3 which stands for dataset1, datset2 and dataset3 respectively. So the respective image sequence will be taken as input as per the input number entered.
* Output window will be prompted which will show the results of every step.
