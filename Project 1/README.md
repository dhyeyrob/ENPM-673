# ENPM673 - Project1
## Introduction
* In this project we are given a task of detetcting custom AR tag from given video files. Post detecting the tag it is required to find the orientation and the ID of the tag. The next task is to superimpose given testudo image on the detected AR tag using hgomography and warp perspective. In the final task we have to draw a 3D cube on the surface of the AR tag using projective geometry.
## Files
* There are eight files in the folder. There are four python files, one testudo image, one reference marker image, one report file and one readme file. The name of python files are as follows:
* part1-a.py
* part1-b.py
* part2-a.py
* part2-b.py
## Libraries Required
* OpenCv
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
## Instructions To Run The Code
* Please copy all the 4 videos in this directory.
* Open the respective python file.
* Check whether all the libraries are installed or not.
* Run the code.
* In part2-a and part2-b user will be required to enter any one of the 0,1,2 or 3 which stands for Tag0, Tag1, Tag2 and multipleTags videos respectively. So the respective video will be taken as input as per the input number entered.
* Output window will be prompted and also the output video will be saved in the folder.
