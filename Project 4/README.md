# ENPM673 - Project2
## Introduction
* In this project we are given two tasks. In the first task we are required apply the concept of sparse and dense optical flow on the given dataset. 
* In the second task we are required develop a CNN model for classification of 9 different species of fishes. And a dataset has been provided for the same.
## Files
* There are total five files in the folder. There are two python files problem1_part1.py and problem1_part2 for problem one, for problem2.ipynb one python file problem2.ipynb, a pdf report file and one readme file.
## Dependancies For Problem 1
* OpenCv
* Numpy
## Dependancies For Problem 2
* Google Colab
## Instructions To Run The Code Of Problem 1
* Please copy the dataset in this directory.
* Open the respective python file in any of the common python ide like Pycharm.
* Check whether all the libraries are installed or not.
* Run the code.
* Output window will be prompted and also the output video will be saved in the folder for both the python files.
## Instructions To Run The Code Of Problem 2
* Please upload the unzipped dataset on google drive.
* Open the python notebook in Google Colab.
* Select 'Mount Drive' option in google colab. After successfully mounting the drive select the folder of the uploaded dataset and by right clicking select 'copy path' and paste the path in the highlighted line 'PLEASE PASTE THE PATH OF DATASET HERE'in the code.
* Run the code.
* Output graphs of accuracy and loss will be plotted at the end for both training and testing data.
