# ENPM673 - Project2
## Introduction
* In this project we are given two tasks. In the first task we are required to enhance the contrast of the given video sequence. 
* In the second task we are provided two data sets which contains two different video sequence of a self driving car recording the lanes, we are required to develop a computer vision pipeline to detect the lanes, overlay detected lanes on original video frames and also carry out turn prediction detection of the vehicle.
## Files
* There are four files in the folder. There are two python files, one pdf report file and one readme file. The name of python files are as follows:
* problem1.py
* problem2.py
## Libraries Required
* OpenCv
* Numpy
* Scipy
* Matplotlib
## Instructions To Run The Code
* Please copy all the 3 datasets in this directory.
* Open the respective python file.
* Check whether all the libraries are installed or not.
* Run the code.
* In problem2.py user will be required to enter any one of the 1 or 2 which stands for dataset1 and dataset2 respectively. So the respective video/image sequence will be taken as input as per the input number entered.
* Output window will be prompted and also the output video will be saved in the folder for both the python files.
